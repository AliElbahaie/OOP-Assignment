Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and created two classes: Car and Road.

Part A 
Created a Car class with various variables such as Car_Brand, Car_Type, Car_Plate, Speed, and Year_Model. Created two constructors and a getter and setter for each variable.

Part B
Created a Road class with variables such as Road_Type and Speed_Limit, along with two constructors. Additionally, created a function called Radar that checks if a car's speed is above 100, and a function called allow that limits certain types of cars from driving on certain roads. Finally, there is a function called age that calculates the age of the car and returns it.

Part C
Wrote a main function that creates a queue filled with several car objects. The cars are then dequeued and passed through the Radar, allow, and age functions of the Road class. The number of cars passed by each road is outputted, and the efficiency of each road is calculated based on the one with the highest number of cars. For example, if Road A had 4 cars, Road B had 6 cars, and Road C had 8 cars, then the efficiency of Road C would be 100%, Road B would be 75%, and Road A would be 50%.
